## THIS IS NOW DEPRECATED, see https://github.com/robmarkcole/Hue-remotes-HASS#suggested-migration

## Use a Philips Hue Dimmer remote to control Sonos player
## Top button cycles through the 'sonos favourites' defined in
## the Robmarkcole custom component is needed: https://github.com/robmarkcole/Hue-remotes-HASS
## the sonos_source "input_select:"
## The automations in input_select_sonos makes the source change.
## second and third button controls volume (steps of 5%)
## fourth button is pause/play

## I was not sure how to get the best responsive-ness using either 1_click or 1_click_up
## Still experimenting.
